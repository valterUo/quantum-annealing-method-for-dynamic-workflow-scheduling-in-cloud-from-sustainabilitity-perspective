    "We develop the model so that we are able to optimize over multiple objectives. Anyway, one of the most comprehensive cloud simulators, CloudSim, does not easily allow control over all of these objectives. For example, in PlanetLab workload the system creates as many virtual machines as there are workloads. The allocation of tasks to virtual machines is pratically random which is not optimal. On the other hand, the system does not allow changes to this allocation during the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In pratice we can optimize the initial task to virtual machine allocation and also virtual machine to physical machine (host) allocation. This is the first optimization round. We model the system as a single datacenter. Including multiple datacenters would not make the approach different except that bandwith between the datacenters must be more limited than bandwith in a single datacenter. These single datacenter simulations also seem to be the standard in the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the initial optimization round, we do not change task-virtual machine allocation because it is not possible in the simulator without extensive modifications to the source code. Instead, we start optimizing virtual machine - physcial machine allocation with respect to sustainability, budget and time. The optimization is performed in intervals. The length of an interval is defined by the user."

    "The solution to the optimization problem is a new allocation of tasks into virtual machines and virtual machines to physical machines. This allocation is represented as a migration map. Unfortunately CloudSim does not implement reallocation of tasks during running simulation so task-virtual machine allocation stays the same after the initial allocation. Thus the migration map describes just virtual machine to physical machine allocation."
